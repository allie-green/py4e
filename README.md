# Python for Everybody

This marks the beginning of my journey with Python - one of the first programming languages I am learning, alongside pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development. As a result, I am excited to share my solutions to the exercises featured in the lessons and book "Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python3," which can be found at the following links:

Furthermore, this is my first repository, and it has provided me with an opportunity to practice utilizing Git and GitHub.
